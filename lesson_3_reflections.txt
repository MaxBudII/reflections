When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you will be working from multiple computers for if you have more that one person working on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If another person is working on the same project you might want to coordinate with the other person before pulling.
