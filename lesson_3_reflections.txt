When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  If you will be working from multiple computers for if you have more that one person working on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If another person is working on the same project you might want to coordinate with the other person before pulling.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	A branch is a second copy of the code in a respository made to allow changes to code without affecting the master branch.  Can be used foe experimental code changes and can be merged to the master branch later.
	A clone is a complete copy of either a remote or local git repository that lives locally
	A fork is a complete copy of a git repository that lives on the GutHub repositoy.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	If you aill be working offline you can get a local copy with the latest commit, work offline, then when back online you can merge any changes.
